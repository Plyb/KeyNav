# Info
I got fed up with websites not being keyboard navigable, so I took matters into my own hands. You can use this extension to search for buttons/inputs/etc on the page and focus to them.

# Installation
Until I finalize this and package it, install it as an under development extension following the instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/)

# Usage
Press Alt+K to open the element selector, search for the element you want, then tab down to the option you want and hit enter.
